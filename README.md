## Astro Pages Overview

The home page is the main page of the website. It is the first page that loads when the user navigates to the website.

The content is structured in blocks. Each block is a component that is responsible for rendering a specific section of the page and all the data is fetched from Strapi from our landing page content type.

### Dynamic Page

This allow a none-technical user to create a new page by just adding and rearranging the blocks.

In this example we are just rendering the person block.
